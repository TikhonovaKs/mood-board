## Tools and stack: 
HTML / CSS / React / API / useContext (state manager)

## Here's what was done:
* Sending GET requests to a public API to fetch random photos upon the initial page load, and filtered photos based on a keyword.
* Creating a custom photo list with the ability to add and remove photos.
* Implementing a popup with zoomed photos and options to save or delete the photo.
* Displaying previously saved photos on the search page by changing the "add" button to a "save" button.
* Implementing a custom hook to display a specific number of photos depending on the screen size and load the next set of photos by clicking the "more" button.
* Using the useContext state manager for searching and storing photos.
